# Health-care-chatbot
Our project develops a multilingual healthcare chatbot to address the lack of reliable health information in underserved communities. Serving as a virtual health companion, it empowers individuals with accurate guidance, fostering proactive health management and mitigating disparities in healthcare knowledge.​

Chatbot overcomes language barriers through its multilingual capabilities and audio option, extending its reach to rural areas and ensuring the effective communication of relevant health information.​
